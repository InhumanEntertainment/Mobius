Post build steps will be explained there for each supported platform.

----------------------------
Getting Started
----------------------------
Open "Assets/Scenes/Reign/ReignDemo.scene".
And look at "ReignDemo.cs" for reference.
Make sure you have the "Assets\Plugins\Reign\Services\ReignServices.prefab" in the Scene for the plugins to work.

----------------------------
Prerequisite before Building
----------------------------
Go to the menu option "Edit/Reign/Set Platform/..." and select your target platform.
This will disable conflicting ".dll" plugin libs from other Reign Unity Plugins.
NOTE: Before you commit your changes to a version control, please run "Edit/Reign/Set Platform/Revert".

----------------------------
Updating
----------------------------
If you have multiple Reign Unity Plugins its a good idea to check and make sure there in versions are in sync via "Edit/Reign/Check Plugin Sync".
If they are not or you are having issues run "Edit/Reign/Check for Updates".
